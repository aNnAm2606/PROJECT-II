# PROJECT-II-ART-BIBLE
 How to make an art bible and what is it? By Anna M.

In my presentation for project II I have explained the following points:

What is an Art Bible?
Why is it important?
What does it consist of?
Examples
Why is it useful?
How to make one: TODOs
Documentation/Links

There is a link to presentation in google slides, it can only be acessed by UPC gmails:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14xpHRTkI8FhCgPIfVB5lXe8hBHeeeFmgcCLxrfkmXXE/edit?usp=sharing

There is also a word document you can download that includes all the TODOs for creating an art bible, and useful
links.
